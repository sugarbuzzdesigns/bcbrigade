						<h3>Lyrics</h3>
						<p class="verse">
							<span>Spent half my life just wishin</span>
							<span>Afraid of the chance I'd been given</span>
							<span>Thought I should ask for forgiveness</span>
							<span>For wanting more</span>						
						</p>	
								
						<p class="chorus">
							<span>I guess that when your searching for a sign</span>
							<span>Sometimes you gotta take look around outside</span>	
						</p>

						<p class="verse">
							<span>It's the only way to learn</span>
							<span>Which bridge to cross and which one to burn</span>
							<span>And you might not get there first and the road is long</span>
							<span>But keep walkin on</span>
						</p>

						<p class="verse">
							<span>Don't wanna say its been easy</span>
							<span>And sometimes my mind is still reelin'</span>
							<span>But I have to keep on believing </span>
							<span>That there's more</span>
						</p>

						<p class="chorus">
							<span>The truth is that you only have one soul</span>
							<span>And two feet to guide your way to walk through the doors</span>
						</p>

						<p class="verse">
							<span>It's the only way to learn</span>
							<span>Which bridge to cross and which one to burn</span>
							<span>And you might not get there first and the road is long</span>
							<span>But keep walkin on</span>
						</p>

						<p class="chorus">
							<span>Ready or not you know a change is gonna come</span>
							<span>It takes every ounce of faith to keep on keeping on keeping on </span>
						</p>

						<p class="chorus">
							<span>It's the only way to learn</span>
							<span>Which bridge to cross and which one to burn</span>
							<span>And you might not get there first and the road is long</span>
							<span>But keep walkin on</span>

						<h3>About</h3>
						<p>Living your life and not being afraid of taking a chance and making mistakes. That’s what this song is all about. You aren’t always going to be right in all your choices and not every path is an easy one, but you learn, you keep moving forward and you become stronger for it. The only real race is against time and the pace that you set is measured only by the passion and drive you contain in your heart. If you happen to breakdown or get lost along the way, its ok. You will still get there, but you gotta keep walking on.</p>

						<span>In a wasteland where nothing good can grow</span>

						<p class="verse">
						<span>I still hear her whisper in the dark</span>

						<h3>About</h3>
						<p>Datura stramonium, known by the common names Jimson weed or Devil's snare, is a plant in the nightshade family.</p>
						<p>It grows wild and is found as a blossoming weed in wastelands and in garbage dumps.</p>
						<p>Jimson Weed has been used in traditional medicine and is also a powerful hallucinogen which is used spiritually for the intense visions it produces. However, these properties are fatally toxic in only slightly higher amounts than the medicinal dosage, and careless use often results in hospitalizations and deaths.</p>

						<p class="verse">
						<span>There was a time when I lived my life the way I wanted to</span>
						<span>Streaks of green passing by not a cloud in the sky and the road was open Then she came along and changed my whole song</span>
						<span>We settled down</span>
						<span>In a little town</span>
						<span>But then I found something was broken</span>

						<p class="chorus">
						<span>(I guess) I should've known the dream don't last forever</span>
						<span>It floats just like a feather on the winds of change</span>
						<span>But there was a part ...a part of me that needed</span>
						<span>Something to hold on to and something to find out on my own I should have known</span>
						</p>

						<p class="verse">
						<span>These days I ride alone playing tunes for anyone who'll listen</span>
						<span>Empty place pretty face comes walking in and a flood of memories take over</span>
						<span>Cuz there once was a girl who'd hang on every word</span>
						<span>We settled down</span>
						<span>In that little town</span>
						<span>But now I know I'm the one that's broken</span>

						<h3>About</h3>
						<p>What goes up can and most certainly will come down. It’s so easy to be short sighted when you are focused so intensely on a goal or a dream that you can forget to notice and appreciate the things that you already have. I believe we are all guilty of this from time to time so try not to take yourself so seriously because mistakes and failure are all part of the long run. Remember. It’s ok if you get knocked down a peg or two. Get back up on your feet, dust yourself off, laugh and learn from it.</p>
